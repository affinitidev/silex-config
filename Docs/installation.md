## Installation

Installation of the `ConfigServiceProvider` is a simple process using Composer.  Since the best way to use Silex is with Composer, this is currently the only supported installation method.

### Installing Composer

If you need to install composer, browse to the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/) for instructions on setting it up.

### Adding to Composer

Open the `composer.json` file in the root of your project, and add the following to the `require` section:

    "affinitidev/silex-config": "dev-master"

Now, you can run `php composer.phar update` and the Config provider should be downloaded and ready to use.
